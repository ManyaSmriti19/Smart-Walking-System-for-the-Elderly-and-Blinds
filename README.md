# Smart-Walking-System-for-the-Elderly-and-Blinds
We propose a smart walking stick system especially made keeping the elderly in mind. With age comes diminishing memory and many more problems that seek support for both balance and navigation- cognitive and motor functions are diminished. Science and technology always make human life easier. Our application is on the go solution. A smart walking system which helps them navigate through life! Additional perks are that it can monitor heart rate and send out alerts to the nearest hospital whilst also alarming the people around for additional help. It also helps them cross the roads in a better and much safer way. Reminders for taking medicines in time/ general reminders can also be provided. We understand that the elderly might even have a very weak sense of vision. Keeping that in mind, we will be constructing a microcontroller based automated software that can corroborate a blind person to detect obstacles in front of him immediately. We implement this using ad hoc networks.
