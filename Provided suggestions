Elderly could have very weak vision, and this is not considered in the current

that helps the elderly. This could signal them and still help the same way even
if they cannot see.
• It will be able to suggest how to cross the roads in a safe manner.
• It can also analyze the heart rate of the person and if it seems to be very high,
then there may be chances of discomfort so the system will suggest a different
route. E.g., there might be a route where there are a lot of stairs or a high slope,
in this case the person’s heart rate would be high. When this is the case, the
stick could suggest an alternative, comfortable route.
• The elderly can only remember so little, they probably forget to take their
medicines. The system can send daily reminders to them so that everything
happens on time.
• If the person using the stick, unfortunately collapses or say, something
happens to them, the stick should be able to sense it and alert the surroundings
by an alarm.
• Our main aim is to make this stick as cost effective and reliable as possible,
keeping in mind that it should be light weighted and portable.
